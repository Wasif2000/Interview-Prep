    <h1>Question No :5</h1>
    <h2>What is the significance, and what are the benefits, of including 'use strict' at the beginning of a JavaScript source file?</h2>

    <h3>The Answer is that</h3>
    <p>Makes debugging easier. Code errors that would otherwise have been ignored or would have failed silently will now generate errors or throw exceptions, alerting you sooner to problems in your code and directing you more quickly to their source.</p>

    <h2>2</h2>
    <p>Throws error on invalid usage of delete. The delete operator (used to remove properties from objects) cannot be used on non-configurable properties of the object. Non-strict code will fail silently when an attempt is made to delete a non-configurable property, whereas strict mode will throw an error in such a case.</p>
